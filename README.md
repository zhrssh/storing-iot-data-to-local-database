# Storing IoT Data to a Remote Database
The scripts allow the NodeMCU or Arduino to communicate with the python program. The python program also has the capability to store the received data into a database. In this activity, the data received is stored in a local database.

# What I have learned
- How to send data from the NodeMCU or Arduino to the python program.
- Create my own database class and allow that class to send query to the database.
